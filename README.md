# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Tobacco Sales to Youth

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the **historical trend of tobacco sales to youth from 1997 to 2018** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The goal is to analyze patterns, detect anomalies, and understand the impact of regulations and awareness campaigns on tobacco consumption and its effect in past 30 years among young people.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **File Name:** `tobacco-sold-to-youth.csv`
- **Number of Records:** 22
- **Columns:**
  - `YEAR` – Year of data collection
  - `PERCENT` – Percentage of tobacco sold to youth
  - `SE` – Standard error of the percentage
  - `LOWER95` – Lower bound of the 95% confidence interval
  - `UPPER95` – Upper bound of the 95% confidence interval

## 🔍 What We Have Done

✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

- Checked for **missing values** (None found ✅).
- Ensured **data types were correct** for numerical analysis.

✅ **Trend Analysis & Visualizations**

- **Line Plot:** Visualized the overall **decline in tobacco sales** over time.
- **Bar Chart:** Compared sales trends in the **last 10 years**.
- **Percentage Decrease Calculation:** Tobacco sales dropped **\~72.02% from 1997 to 2018**.
- **Outlier Detection:** Used a **box plot** and identified 1997 (\~21.7%) as an **outlier**.

✅ **Value Created & Insights Generated**

- **Confirmed that tobacco sales to youth have significantly declined** over the past two decades.
- **Identified the good drop after the early 2000s**, shows a possible impact of stronger regulations and awareness campaigns..
- \*\*Outlier analysis confirmed that 1997 had an high percentage of tobaco usage compared to other years.

✅ **Predictive Modeling (Future Work)**

- To Implement **Linear Regression** to project **future trends (2019-2030)**.



## 🚀 Future Work

🔹 **Next Steps:**

- After mastering **machine learning**, incorporate **advanced models** to improve prediction accuracy.
- Explore external data (e.g., **cigarette pricing, government regulations**) for deeper insights.
